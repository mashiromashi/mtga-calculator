A simple calculator for people who want to keep track of win-loss, net gem gained/lost.

Idea inspired by the excel sheet of <a>twitch.tv/GoingOptimal</a>

Source of the Sheet : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oKjuK583K5CXdnMRp_XhCYa66IWIsbKuD_qb_VbFpXc/edit?usp=sharing

Please make your own copy before editing. 

Will be hosted somewhere (i will update the site address when i do) 

In development for now.

Currently it uses `localstorage` of the browser for the data entry but I'm open to suggestions.

Feel free to pull request or open issues if you have any ideas.
